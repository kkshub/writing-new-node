# Overview

In Fire Insights, you can write your own processor in Spark, Java, or Scala, and plug them into Fire Insights. Once these processors are available made to Fire Insights via a jar file, they appear within the Fire Insights Workflow Editor. Users can use these new processors like any other processor within Fire Insights. This repository contains a few sample processors to get your started.
