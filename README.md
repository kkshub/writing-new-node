# Overview

Sparkflows allows you to write your own Node/Operators in Spark/Java/Scala and plug them into Sparkflows. They appear within the Sparkflows Workflow Editor and users can easily use them.

This repository contains a few sample Nodes based on which new nodes can be created. The jar file of the code can be placed in Sparkflows, workflows built and executed as a Spark Job.

For more examples on writing nodes in Sparkflows, refer:
